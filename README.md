1. connection.html is a simple web page making the use of WEB BLE API which allow website to receive data sent by Bluetooth Device.
2. connection.py is a simple python program making use of pyserial library to receive data sent by Bluetooth Device.
3. ble_but_weird.ino is an arduino program that send a dummy data of size 1024*1024 byte through BLE to the central device.
